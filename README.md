# ðŸ“ƒTODO

+ I can't hide foreground page(UWP) for now.
+ Save added data & load data before MainPage initialization.
+ Please note that you should stop all processes before closing the app. I've noted the bug [here](https://moeext.github.io/2020/09/30/fancy-toys-notes/#%E7%88%B6%E8%BF%9B%E7%A8%8B%E9%80%80%E5%87%BA%E5%90%8E%EF%BC%88%E5%AD%90%E8%BF%9B%E7%A8%8B%E4%B8%8D%E9%80%80%E5%87%BA%EF%BC%89%E7%AB%AF%E5%8F%A3%E4%B8%8D%E9%87%8A%E6%94%BE).
+ I really wanna expand the content into the title bar area. I tried but lost. As you can see, I've used arcylic in the title bar area.
